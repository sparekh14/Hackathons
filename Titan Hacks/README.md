This was a project for the Titan Hacks Hackathon on April 11-12, 2020 hosted by the San Marino Hack Club.

This project is a calculator with a variety of functions and usage. The idea for this project came from the fact that most calculators only have simple functions, so this calculator was created to have many more functions such as calculating area and volume, converting between temperature scales, and more.
